\title{Identify Kmer overlaps}
\usage{
findKmerOverlap.old(
  peptide_df,
  KMER_SIZE = 7,
  peptide.id.col = "peptide_id",
  sequence.col = "sequence"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peptide_df}{phage peptide count matrix}

\item{KMER_SIZE}{size of Kmer <default: 7>}

\item{peptide.id.col}{column name for peptide IDs in input data frame <default: "peptide_id">}

\item{sequence.col}{column name for peptide AA sequences in input data frame <default: "sequence">}
}
\value{
returns phage results with a 'KmerOverlap' column quantifying the number of Kmer overlaps. In addition, a 'PeptideOverlap' column with the number of peptide overlaps.
}
\description{
takes input of phage results and finds all Kmer overlaps among all peptide sequences
then returns a subset of phage results with peptides that contain overlaps
}
\examples{
findKmerOverlap.old(peptide_df,KMER_SIZE = 7)
}
